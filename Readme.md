# TodoPP GUI

This is a Todo program that utilizes the [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) format for todo files.



This project aims to be a full reference guide for the [TodoPP library](https://github.com/Abdulla2/TodoPP).

It's work in progress it lacks for now:

* A compelling UI.

* A good documentation.

* Support for search, projects and tags.

Also everything that is not supported yet in the original library.

A nice to have features in the far future are:

* The support of themes.

* The support for mobile phones.

* Support of multiple files import and export.

## Build

You can build using Qt-Creator it uses Cmake.

You can also:

```
cmake .
```

In the project root directory.


For any addition don't hesitate to open a pull request.
